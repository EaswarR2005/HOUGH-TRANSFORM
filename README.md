# Hough-Transform
## Aim:
To write a Python program to detect the lines using Hough Transform.

## Software Required:
Anaconda - Python 3.7

## Algorithm:

### Step 1:

Import all the necessary modules for the program.

### Step 2:

Load a image using imread() from cv2 module.

### Step 3:

Convert the image to grayscale.

### Step 4:

Using Canny operator from cv2,detect the edges of the image.

### Step 5:

Using the HoughLinesP(),detect line co-ordinates for every points in the images.Using For loop,draw the lines on the found co-ordinates.Display the image.

# OUTPUT:

<img width="651" height="465" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b1eed6b-6299-4693-b6f1-784efa4f06dc" />

# Result:

Thus the python program to detect the lines using Hough Transform was successfully completed.
